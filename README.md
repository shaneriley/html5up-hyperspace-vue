# HTML5Up Hyperspace Vue Template

As an initial exercise with Vue.js, I chose to convert an [HTML5Up](http://html5up.net/)
template to a series of Vue "apps" with internal components that obtain their
data from a central data source. This data could be fed in whole or in part
from a CMS with relative ease.

## Setup

* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
* `open http://localhost:8080`
